I Enjoyed Horticulture, in particular, soft landscaping for 30 years. My passion started with learning the science and practice and developed into the personal fitness of the activity that kept me healthy in spite of my vices well into my 40s. I even had the privilege of aiding others in gaining experience in the industry, this I failed to enjoy as I should. I am no longer physically able to provide value on site anymore, so I am taking this as an opportunity to explore new career directions. Although I will, if requested provide Horticultural, Landscaping, and site maintenance consultations; I am feeling more inclined to learn the more social aspects of business administration, marketing, and the logic of coding.
I plan this year to open my Forkbeard Services which will platform my skills developed this year.
As I learn I am experimenting with Ecommerce and marketing so feel free to browse both my ebay and facebook stores.
